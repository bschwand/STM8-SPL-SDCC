                        Example Description \
                        This firmware provides a basic example of how to use the I2C firmware library and\
                        an associate I2C EEPROM driver to communicate with an I2C EEPROM device (here the\
                        example is interfacing with M24C64 EEPROM)\
                          \
                        I2C peripheral is configured in Master transmitter during write operation and in\
                        Master receiver during read operation from I2C EEPROM. \
                          \
                        I2C peripheral speed is set to 200kHz and can be configured by \
                        modifying the relative define in stm8s_eval_i2c_ee.h file.\
                         \
                        For M24C64 devices all the memory is accessible through the two-bytes \
                        addressing mode and need to define block addresses. In this case, only the physical \
                        address has to be defined (according to the address pins (E0,E1 and E2) connection).\
                        This address is defined in stm8s_eval_i2c_ee.h (default is 0xA0: E0, E1 and E2 tied to ground).\
                        The EEPROM addresses where the program start the write and the read operations \
                        is defined in the main.c file. \
                         \
                        First, the content of Tx1_Buffer is written to the EEPROM_WriteAddress1 and the\
                        written data are read. The written and the read buffers data are then compared.\
                        Following the read operation, the program waits that the EEPROM reverts to its \
                        Standby state. A second write operation is, then, performed and this time, Tx2_Buffer\
                        is written to EEPROM_WriteAddress2, which represents the address just after the last \
                        written one in the first write. After completion of the second write operation, the \
                        written data are read. The contents of the written and the read buffers are compared.\
